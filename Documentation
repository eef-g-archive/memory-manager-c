This program is a memory manager program that manages memory allocation and deallocation. 
It uses a linked list to keep track of the free memory blocks and the busy memory blocks. 
The program has two modes of operation: first fit and best fit. 
In first fit mode, the program searches for the first free block of memory that is large enough to hold the requested size. 
In best fit mode, the program searches for the smallest free block of memory that is large enough to hold the requested size. 
The program has three main functions: Manager_new, Manager_init, and Manager_allocate.
Manager_new creates a new manager object with a specified size and mode. 
Manager_init initializes an existing manager object with a specified size and mode. 
Manager_allocate allocates a new block of memory with a specified size.
